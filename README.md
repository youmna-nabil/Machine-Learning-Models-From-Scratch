# Machine Learning Models from Scratch


## Overview

This repository is dedicated to implementing **machine learning models from scratch** using Python. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented code for educational purposes, helping developers understand the inner workings of ML algorithms without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for core implementations. Each model is built from the ground up, with explanations of the underlying mathematics and logic.

### Objectives
- Develop ML algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks) from scratch.
- Provide detailed code comments and documentation for learning purposes.
- Include examples and datasets to demonstrate model usage.
- Encourage contributions to expand the collection of algorithms.
